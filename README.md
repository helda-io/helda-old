## Motivation

"It is better to have 100 functions operate on one data structure than to have 10 functions operate on 10 data structures." - Alan J. Perlis

Helda is a Spring for Clojure

The goal of Helda is to make reusable Clojure code that works with application state and use pure functions as handlers to modify application state.

## Features

* Provide meta info for application state (fields, constraints)
* Seeding application state and fixtures for application state
* Describing application input as messages and pure functions as handlers
